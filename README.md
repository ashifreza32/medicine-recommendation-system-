The system enables users to register securely, input their symptoms through a simple web interface, and receive an instant prediction of the most probable disease using a trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Leveraging comprehensive and reliable medical datasets, the application provides detailed disease information, prevention tips, recommended medications, exercise routines, and dietary guidance for each prediction. 

A key feature of this system is its secure user authentication and personalized consultation history. Each user's interactions, including symptoms entered and recommendations received, are securely logged and can be reviewed for future reference, supporting ongoing self-care and health tracking.
